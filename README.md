# React.js Study Jam üöÄ

Welcome to the official repository for the GDG On Campus UICT React.js Study Jam! This project is designed to be a hands-on, interactive workshop that will take you from the core concepts of React to building your very first interactive web application.

## What We'll Build: A Persistent To-Do List

In this session, we will build a fully functional, interactive, and persistent To-Do List application from scratch.

**Features include:**
*   Adding new tasks to the list.
*   Marking tasks as complete with a satisfying strikethrough.
*   Deleting tasks you no longer need.
*   **Persistence!** Your tasks will be saved in your browser's `localStorage`, so they won't disappear when you refresh the page.

## ‚úÖ Core Concepts We'll Cover

This workshop is designed to give you a strong foundation in the most essential React concepts:

- **JSX:** Writing HTML-like markup directly in JavaScript.
- **Components:** Building reusable UI pieces.
- **State (`useState`):** Giving components their own memory to manage data.
- **Props:** Passing data and functions from parent to child components.
- **Rendering Lists (`.map()`):** Dynamically displaying arrays of data.
- **Handling Forms:** Creating "controlled components" to manage user input.
- **Side Effects (`useEffect`):** Interacting with systems outside of React, like browser storage.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Showing or hiding UI based on application state.

## üíª Running Locally (After the Study Jam)

If you'd like to run this project on your own machine after the workshop, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher) installed.
*   Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nedpals/react-study-jam-todo.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd react-study-jam-todo
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
